/*Creat a file called blogs.html in the same location as your index.html file.

Create a file in the javascripts folder called blogs.js and link this file to your blogs HTML page

Create an object for each of your blogs. Each blog should have a unique id.

Put all the objects in a single array called blogs.*/


/*Create two functions:
writeToDom: this function should accept a string and print it to a div with an id of my-projects

createBlogPosts: this function should loop through the BLOGS array and build up the html for each blog.
 It should call the writeToDom function for each blog.

The last line of this file should be: createBlogPosts();*/

        post: `Last week I started new project Travel Diary with my awesome team Venus Flytrap. The main goal was to create array of objects then print each object to the DOM. Also, each object supposed to have an input section that would aloud user to add notes. Moreover, every time user add note it would appear at the bottom of the page as a new separate box which would include note itself and country location.
        During this project I was struggling with pulling specific data from input and printing it to the notes section. I spend whole day trying to figure out how to deal with it. Finally I decided to take a break...
       Magic happen during my break. I suddenly realize that I can use data attributes that would aloud me to store and reuse specific information.
       Lesson learned: if you stuck on coding then itâ€™s time to take a break.`

According to portfolio requirements it supposed to be build with HTML5 and CSS.
