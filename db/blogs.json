        "Last week I started new project Travel Diary with my awesome team Venus Flytrap. The main goal was to create array of objects then print each object to the DOM. Also, each object supposed to have an input section that would aloud user to add notes. Moreover, every time user add note it would appear at the bottom of the page as a new separate box which would include note itself and country location. During this project I was struggling with pulling specific data from input and printing it to the notes section. I spend whole day trying to figure out how to deal with it. Finally I decided to take a break...Magic happen during my break. I suddenly realize that I can use data attributes that would aloud me to store and reuse specific information. Lesson learned: if you stuck on coding then itâ€™s time to take a break."

        "Working on my personal page. Decided to build a new portfolio bc old one was not responsive in a browser. According to portfolio requirements it supposed to be build with HTML5 and CSS. Sounds easy but since I taught myself to work with the bootstrap it took me some time to refresh my knowledge with flex box. It was a good practice for me to go over basic material"
